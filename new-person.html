		<h1>Hello New Person! Welcome!  It's prolly awkward for you to be here for the first time, and not quite sure of what this is.  So here's something to read so you feel less awkard!</h1>
		<h2 class="cd">This is a regular night for coding, dreaming, building, socializing, and magic.</h2>
		<h2 class="cd">It's a time to work on a project you'd been wanting time for.</h2>
		<h2 class="cd">It's a time to see what all your friends are working on</h2>
		<h2 class="cd">It's deeply solarpunk</h2>
        <h2>It's also a time to just do what you want.  Read a comic in the corner and let yourself relax!</h2>
        <h2 class="cd">If you want to work on a project with people, check out the project board at the front of the room.  Everything folks are working will be listed.  Add yours here too, if you'd like!</h2>
        <h2 class="cd">If you ahve any questions, I am the person wearing a dog sweatshirt and am happy to help!</h2>
        <h2 class="cd">Many of us are also talking right now through the cool decentralized solarpunk social network <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz">Scuttlebutt.</a> Join us on there!  I can help you get started, if you'd like</h2>
        <h2 class="cd">Above all else, dream and have fun and thank you again for coming!</h2>
